# UIU_Student_Activity_Tracker

1. Introduction
This document is a software requirement specification for the UIU Student
Activity Tracker. After giving information about the project at the beginning of the
document, we will give a complete description for overview and list the
requirements which meet the needs of the company.
1.1 Overview
We aim to build a system for the students of UIU, where their official and
unofficial achievementsâ€™ will be tracked and verified. If the student attends any
event, seminar or project show then it will be added in his/her profile. This type of
profile will guide any faculty in writing a recommendation letter for a student.
1.2 Motivation
This system will be helpful for the students as well as the alumni of UIU to gather
all of their achievements. Students will find it easier in making CVs and resumes.
Students will have the incentive to work harder as they will be able to showcase
their achievements.To write recommendation letters will be easier for the faculty
