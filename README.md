# Computer_Security_Project_UIUSAT

1. Project Overview

The system UIU Student Activity Tracker (UIUSAT) is for the students of UIU, where their official and unofficial achievements’ will be tracked and verified. If the student attends any event, seminar or project show then it will be added in his/her profile. This type of profile will guide any faculty in writing a recommendation letter for a student.

This system will be helpful for the students as well as the alumni of UIU to gather all of their achievements. Students will find it easier in making CVs and resumes. Students will have the incentive to work harder as they will be able to showcase their achievements.To write recommendation letters will be easier for the faculty members.


2. Features of the System

Our system will mainly consist of the following features with brief description.

Profile-

Achievements such as projects, internships, certificates, etc, will be displayed. Students can show their achievements in the profile where skills will be used as keywords, which is helpful when faculty members search for the skill. The achievements will be displayed in categories. Faculty members can visit the students' profiles.

Show Achievements-

To gather all the projects in one place to show the academic works done by and outside skills of a student. So when a faculty will go through a student’s profile, this will help them write a strong recommendation letter for the student.
Workflow: A student can share their project, internships, and other skills in the profile. When the student will upload any achievement, the student can request a faculty member for verification of that achievement. It may then be verified by that faculty member.

Events-

Events refer to events by clubs, programming contests, concerts, seminars/webinars, etc., where mass participation exists.
Workflow: The moderators can create events and tag the students that participated, who, in turn, will receive notification about this event. If they accept the tag, it will be added to their profile. Only the faculty members, moderators and the clubs’ representatives can create the events. Regular students won’t be able to do this.

Tag-

Workflow: Events will be created by admins. The admins may 'tag' students who were part of these events to send them a notification to accept the achievement. Only the people who create events will be able to tag others.

Notification-

Workflow: Whenever a new event will be added, a notification will be sent to the tagged people in the event for them to add that achievement to their profile. Students can request faculty members to approve an achievement, in which case a notification will be sent to the faculty member.

Search-

Workflow: Faculty members will be able to search individual students, events, skills ( programming languages, sports, cultural activities, etc ), courses, etc. From there, they may tag the students, or just view the profile information. Students will be able to search teachers and events. From there, students may request faculties to add them in an event as a participant.

Achievement Verification-

Students can 'tag' a faculty member for verifying their achievement. A 'Notification' will reach the faculty. The faculty can look into the achievement and verify it (maybe via a tick mark).

Data Control-

The user has full control of their data. They can delete any data of theirs whenever they want, and our servers won't retain the data.
