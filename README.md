# UIU_Student_Activity_Tracker

The system UIU Student Activity Tracker (UIUSAT) is for the students of UIU, where their official and unofficial achievementsâ€™ will be tracked and verified. If the student attends any event, seminar or project show then it will be added in his/her profile. This type of profile will guide any faculty in writing a recommendation letter for a student.

This system will be helpful for the students as well as the alumni of UIU to gather all of their achievements. Students will find it easier in making CVs and resumes. Students will have the incentive to work harder as they will be able to showcase their achievements.To write recommendation letters will be easier for the faculty members.
